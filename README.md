This is a Python 2.7 implementation of the Persistent Path Homology (PPH) package described in the aforementioned paper. 

To test that the code is running properly, type in the following from the command line:

  python pph.py tests\cycleNet11.txt

The output should look like:

['pph.py', 'tests\\cycleNet11.txt']
('pers bars are', [['0-dim bars are ', [(0.0, 1.0), (0.0, 1.0), (0.0, 1.0), (0.0, 1.0), (0.0, 1.0), (0.0, 1.0), (0.0, 1.0), (0.0, 1.0), (0.0, 1.0), (0.0, 1.0), (0.0, 10000.0)]], ['1-dim bars are ', [(1.0, 6.0)]]])
